# Data-Management-for-Data-Science

Repo for my DMDS course showcasing SQL abilities.

The course covers both "classical" data management techniques from the 60's through 80's (including relational databases, SQL query language, concurrency) and more "modern" data management techniques from the 90's to the present (including big data, noSQL, replication, distribution, map-reduce, hadoop, spark).
